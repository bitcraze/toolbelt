# Toolbelt [![CI](https://github.com/bitcraze/toolbelt/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/bitcraze/toolbelt/actions?query=workflow%3ACI)

The Toolbelt is a utility to run tools for testing and building of software modules.
The tools are run in an dockerized environment where toolchains and frameworks
are installed, and thus removes the need to install compilers and so on on your
local system.
