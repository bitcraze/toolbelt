The toolbelt is a utility to run tools for testing and building of software modules.
The tools are run in an dockerized environment where toolchains and frameworks
are installed, and thus removes the need to install compilers and so on on your
local system.

The basic idea behind the Toolbelt is to provide an easy to access tool that helps the user to do common tasks in
Bitcraze projects, without installing a lot of special tool-chains, libs or programs. The intention is also to
harmonize the use in all our projects to make them as similar as possible and reduce the cognitive load when switching
between repositories.
